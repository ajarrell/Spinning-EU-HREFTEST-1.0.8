                            <span class="author">Posted by Edwin on Feb 7th 2017</span>
                            <p class="review">Since I was getting bored of my treadmill, a new toy was needed. So Spinning® was the best step. I wanted to buy something not too expensive to see how it goes. So far I am really enjoying the experience and this bike runs very well.</p>

                            <span class="author">Posted by a Spinning.com Customer on Jan 10th 2017</span>
                            <p class="review">I love my new Spinner® Sprint! It's well-made, durable, and rides like my road bike. The workout CDs included are also fantastic! There's no question I'll be able to maintain my fitness level throughout the winter until the roads are cleared for biking outside. The purchase was definitely worth it and I look forward to many years of spinning. Thanks you guys!</p>

                            <p class="review">The Shift has met all my needs and after using it for a month I can tell that it will outlast me and will be something that I can pass along to my children...One of the best features of the Shift for me is the adjustability of both the seat and handlebars which make it easy for other family members to set to their height and comfort…It doesn't sway and is solid and stable...Overall, I'm very pleased with the Shift.</p>
